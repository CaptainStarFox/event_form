# event_form
I chose an event form for my project it provides a structured, user-friendly, and accessible way for participants to sign up for an event. By using HTML, CSS, and built-in validation features, the form ensures that users input the correct information while maintaining a clean and professional design. The inclusion of labels, placeholders, and required fields enhances usability, making it easy for attendees to complete the form without confusion. The use of the CSS Box Model ensures proper spacing and alignment, contributing to a well-organized layout. The form is also responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile users.
